<p>Welcome to the online repository for the code that makes up Get Live Workforce. The Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tool or job function application is built using rapid prototyping in Bootstrap with the majority of the backend code consisting of Ruby on Rails (RoR).</p>

<p>Main files to keep an eye on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>index.html - This is your homepage.</li>
  <li>user-dash.html - As you guessed it is the initial user dashboard.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will be updating this README on a regular basis as the project progresses and we add more files.</p>
